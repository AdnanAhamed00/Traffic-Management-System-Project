# Traffic-Management-System-Project
This project aims to develop a Traffic Management System using C++. It provides functionalities to record new vehicles, search vehicle records, search traffic control booths, control traffic, and obtain help information. The project is implemented in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) using C++ programming language.

Overview:
This project aims to develop a Traffic Management System using C++. It provides functionalities to record new vehicles, search vehicle records, search traffic control booths, control traffic, and obtain help information. The project is implemented in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) using C++ programming language.

Requirements:
- IDE: Code::Blocks or VS Code
- Text Editor: Any preferred text editor
- Operating System: Windows 10 or the latest version (Other operating systems can be used too)
    
concept used :
1. Multithreading: The project can leverage multithreading to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. For example, threads can be utilized to manage the traffic control booths simultaneously while allowing the main program to perform other tasks.

2. File System: The project can interact with the operating system's file system to store and retrieve data. For instance, the program may create and access files to store vehicle records and challenge information. The file system API provided by the operating system is used for file manipulation operations like reading from and writing to files.

3. Process Scheduling: The operating system's process scheduling mechanism comes into play when executing the project. The process scheduler determines the execution order of different parts of the program, ensuring fair allocation of CPU resources to the various tasks involved in traffic management.

4. Interprocess Communication: In cases where multiple instances of the Traffic Management System are running or different processes within the system need to exchange information, interprocess communication mechanisms provided by the operating system can be utilized. This allows for seamless communication between processes, enabling efficient data sharing.

5. Memory Management: The project interacts with the operating system for memory management operations. This involves allocating memory resources to variables, objects, and data structures, as well as managing memory deallocation when no longer needed. The use of dynamic memory allocation with `new` and `delete` operators in C++ involves the assistance of the operating system's memory management mechanisms.

6. Error Handling: Error handling techniques are implemented within the project to manage exceptional situations. The code utilizes try-catch blocks in C++ to catch and handle potential errors, ensuring graceful termination or recovery from exceptions that may occur during program execution.

7. System Calls: The project may invoke various system calls provided by the operating system to perform specific operations. These system calls can include file I/O operations for reading or writing data, process management operations for creating and managing processes, and other relevant operations that rely on the functionalities offered by the operating system.

By incorporating these operating system concepts with the C++ code, the Traffic Management System project achieves effective utilization of system resources, efficient task management, and seamless interaction with the operating system's functionalities.
Key Features:
1. Record New Vehicles: Users can add new vehicles by entering registration numbers and owner's names.
2. Search Vehicle Records: Users can search for vehicle records using registration numbers or owner's names.
3. Search Traffic Control Booths: Users can find information about traffic control booths in different locations.
4. Control Traffic: Functionality to control and manage traffic efficiently.
5. Help Information: Provides information on nearby hospitals in case of emergencies.

Usage:
1. Set up the development environment by installing the recommended IDE and text editor.
2. Clone or download the project source code from the GitHub repository.
3. Compile and run the project using the IDE's build and run commands.
4. Navigate through the user interface to access different functionalities.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to record new vehicles, search for vehicle records, control traffic, and retrieve help information.
